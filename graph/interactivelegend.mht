% INTERACTIVELEGEND    Makes a figure interactive
%   This function make plots in a figure act in an interactive way: when
%   selected, they are highlighted and an associated tag is shown. =
Clicking
%   on the axes background unselects the plot. This can be used to avoid
%   the use of a cumbersome legend when a figure contains many plots.
%
%   Syntaxes:
%
%       interactivelegend(handles);
%       interactivelegend(handles,opts);
%
%   These syntaxes enable interactivity for the plots whose handles are =
given
%   in vector "handles", and displays their 'Tag' property (which are =
empty
%   strings by default). Details of how the plots are highlighted are =
given
%   in the (optional) structure "opts". See below for a description of =
the
%   option structure "opts".
%
%   Vector "handles" can also contain handles to axes: interactivelegend =

%   then automatically finds the axes' children and all the plot objects
%   in these axes will be interactive. Thus, the function can be simply
%   called for the current figure with the command "gca" in lieu of =
vector
%   "handles":
%  =20
%       interactivelegend(gca)
%
%   will actually work.
%
%   Syntaxes:
%
%       interactivelegend(handles,tags);
%       interactivelegend(handles,tags,opts);
%
%   These syntaxes first assign the tags in cell array "tags" to the =
plots'
%   'Tag' properties, and displays them when they are highlighted as
%   before.
%
%   The optional structure "opts" is used to adjust various properties =
of
%   the interactive objects. Note that field names are case sensitive.
%
%       opts.selected.Color         is the plot's highlighted color
%       opts.selected.LineStyle     is the plot's highlighted linestyle
%       opts.selected.LineWidth     is the plot's highlighted linewidth
%       ...                        =20
%
%   In general, any plot object property can be adjusted using the field
%   opts.selected.PROPERTY.=20
%
%       opts.unselected             is a structure describing the
%                                   unselected plots properties.
%
%   By default, opts.unselected is simply the original property =
structure,
%   so that opts.unselected needs not be specified. If specified, the
%   properties in opts.unselected are applied to the plots when they are
%   not selected.
%
%       opts.tag.Color              is the text tag's color
%       ...
%
%   In general, any text tag property can be adjusted using the field
%   opts.tag.PROPERTY. In particular, opts.tag.Color defaults to=20
%   opts.selected.Color. Note however that opts.tag.String should not be
%   specified since it will override the displayed text (and will be the
%   same for all tags).
%
%       opts.pointer               is the figure's pointer
%
%   Default is a crosshair; see set(gcf,'Pointer') for all pointer =
types.
%
%   If structure "opts" is ommitted, the following default values are =
used:
%
%       opts.selected.Color =3D 'r';
%       opts.selected.LineWidth =3D 2;
%       opts.tag.Color =3D 'r';
%       opts.pointer =3D 'crosshair';
%
%   Note that "opts" is stored in the 'UserData' fields of all the axes
%   containing interactive objects. Any data which is stored in the =
axes'=20
%   'UserData' field will be overwritten. Additionnal fields are created
%   by interactivelegend in structure "opts" to store the interactive
%   objects' states. This means that bad behavior will be obtained if =
the
%   function is called successively after each plot, such as in:
%
%       hold on;
%       p1 =3D plot(...);
%       interactivelegend(p1);
%       p2 =3D plot(...);
%       interactivelegend(p2);
%       etc.
%
%   Each time interactivelegend is called, data from the previous calls =
is
%   erased from the axes 'UserData' field. The correct way to do this =
would
%   be:
%
%       hold on;
%       p1 =3D plot(...);
%       p2 =3D plot(...);
%       interactivelegend([p1 p2]);
%
%   or even:
%
%       hold on;
%       plot(...);
%       plot(...);
%       interactivelegend(gca);
%
%   Function interactivelegend should be called at most one time for =
each
%   axes; if the provided handles span many axes, the function will =
still
%   work but the interactive objects will behave as a single set (e.g.
%   selected plots in one axes will be deselected if another axes
%   containing interactive plots are selected, whereas different axes =
will
%   behave independantly if interactivelegend is called once for each
%   axes).

%  =20
%   2003-10-08  Correct handling of handles spanning multiple axes
%               implemented: when giving a vector of handles to the
%               function, the objects acts one coherent set (e.g. are
%               deselected when the background of another axes set is
%               clicked), while they behave separately if the function =
is
%               called for each axes.

%
%   2005-04-19  Fix: tag now appears above all other plot elements.
